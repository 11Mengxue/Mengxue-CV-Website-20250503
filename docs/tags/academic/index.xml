      <description>&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, I was awarded the University of Sheffield‚Äôs competitive PGR Publication Scholarship, a prestigious award recognizing impactful doctoral research. My application was reviewed by a panel of Faculty Directors of Postgraduate Research and selected for its significance and contribution to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholarship supports the completion and publication of my PhD research, which investigates how urban greenery influences PM2.5 concentrations using a novel Multi-view Urban Vegetation Index (MvUVI) and ultra-high-resolution spatiotemporal data analysis. &lt;strong&gt;I was the first recipient from the School of Architecture and Landscape to receive this award.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This support enables me to focus on preparing multiple journal submissions to share the findings of my work on vegetation, urban form, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
