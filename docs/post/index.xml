      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, I was recognised as an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) by Advance HE. This professional recognition reflects my experience supporting teaching and learning across undergraduate and postgraduate modules at the University of Sheffield, particularly in architecture, planning, and GIS-related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award demonstrates my commitment to effective, student-focused teaching and aligns with the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In July 2024, I was awarded the University of Sheffield‚Äôs competitive PGR Publication Scholarship, a prestigious award recognizing impactful doctoral research. My application was reviewed by a panel of Faculty Directors of Postgraduate Research and selected for its significance and contribution to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scholarship supports the completion and publication of my PhD research, which investigates how urban greenery influences PM2.5 concentrations using a novel Multi-view Urban Vegetation Index (MvUVI) and ultra-high-resolution spatiotemporal data analysis. &lt;strong&gt;I was the first recipient from the School of Architecture and Landscape to receive this award.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This support enables me to focus on preparing multiple journal submissions to share the findings of my work on vegetation, urban form, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
