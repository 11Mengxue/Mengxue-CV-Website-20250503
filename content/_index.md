      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My work sits at the intersection of environmental modeling, urban form analysis, and data science.

        I develop tools and frameworks to quantify how urban form, vegetation, and human activity interact to shape PM2.5 distribution across time and space. This involves integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques (e.g., street view image segmentation, random forest), spatial clustering, and AI-based predictive modeling using remote sensing and monitoring data.

        I am also interested in high-resolution, city-scale data collection and analysis, and in exploring how AI-driven, big-data tools could support data-informed urban policy and design for healthier, more breathable environments.
