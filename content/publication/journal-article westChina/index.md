abstract: 'With the rapid progress of urbanization, PM2.5 pollution in urban street canyons has become increasingly severe. This study takes typical street canyons in Harbin during different seasons as research objects, using Leaf Area Density (LAD) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) as measurement indicators to analyze the relationship between green interface parameters and PM2.5 concentration levels. Through analysis and mining of field measurement data, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) PM2.5 concentrations in typical street spaces are significantly higher in winter than in summer, with the morning values averaging 37.75% higher than those in the afternoon; (2) the presence of shrub belts contributes positively to PM2.5 reduction, with an average contribution rate of 18.62%; (3) a significant negative correlation exists between LAD and PM2.5 concentration, while LAI shows a weaker correlation. These findings suggest that LAD may serve as a more appropriate indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of green interfaces in mitigating PM2.5 concentrations in street canyon environments.'
