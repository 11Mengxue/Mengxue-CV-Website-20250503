abstract: Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health and well-being. In recent decades, researchers have used direct measurements and predictive modelling to assess urban air quality. However, the impact of vegetation and urban form on air quality remains uncertain, particularly regarding their interconnected roles. This paper systematically reviews studies on real urban environments, focusing on how vegetation and urban form influence air quality assessment and prediction. It highlights key variables and their importance, as reported in the literature, and identifies areas needing further research to improve predictions of vegetationâ€™s effects on urban air quality in relation to urban morphology.
