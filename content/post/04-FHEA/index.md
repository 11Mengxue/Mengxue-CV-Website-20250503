In May 2025, I was recognised as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) by Advance HE. This professional recognition reflects my sustained contribution to higher education teaching and learning, particularly in interdisciplinary modules across architecture, urban planning, and urban data analysis.

Building on my earlier recognition as an Associate Fellow (AFHEA), the FHEA status affirms my commitment to inclusive, student-focused, and research-informed teaching practice, aligned with the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).
