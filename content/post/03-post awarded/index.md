In May 2023, I received the Best Visual Skills ‚Äì Postgraduate Researcher Year 2 award at the ARC Research Poster Competition, hosted by the Department of Architecture, University of Sheffield. The poster presented an overview of my PhD research outline, originally developed for my Confirmation Review, highlighting the relationship between urban vegetation and PM2.5 distribution.

This recognition reflects both the clarity of my research communication and my approach to data-driven visual storytelling in environmental research.
