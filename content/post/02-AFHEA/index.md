In January 2024, I was recognised as an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) by Advance HE. This professional recognition reflects my experience supporting teaching and learning across undergraduate and postgraduate modules at the University of Sheffield, particularly in architecture, planning, and GIS-related subjects.

The award demonstrates my commitment to effective, student-focused teaching and aligns with the UK Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).
