On 30 May 2025, I successfully passed my PhD viva with **minor corrections**, marking a significant milestone in my academic journey.

This achievement represents the culmination of three and a half years of dedicated research, during which I explored the intersections of urban morphology, air quality, and machine learning. I am sincerely grateful to my supervisor, **Dr Chengzhi Peng**, and co-supervisor, **Dr Michael Smith**, for their continuous guidance, encouragement, and support throughout this period.

I would also like to thank my viva examiners, **Professor Anil Namdeo** and **Dr Paul Brindley**, for their insightful feedback and thoughtful suggestions on the future development of my work.

As the next step, I will be preparing my research for publication with the support of the PGR Publication Scholarship. I look forward to sharing these outcomes and continuing to contribute to the field.
