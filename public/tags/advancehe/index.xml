      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 30 May 2025, I successfully passed my PhD viva with &lt;strong&gt;minor corrections&lt;/strong&gt;, marking a significant milestone in my academic journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This achievement represents the culmination of three and a half years of dedicated research, during which I explored the intersections of urban morphology, air quality, and machine learning. I am sincerely grateful to my supervisor, &lt;strong&gt;Dr Chengzhi Peng&lt;/strong&gt;, and co-supervisor, &lt;strong&gt;Dr Michael Smith&lt;/strong&gt;, for their continuous guidance, encouragement, and support throughout this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank my viva examiners, &lt;strong&gt;Professor Anil Namdeo&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dr Paul Brindley&lt;/strong&gt;, for their insightful feedback and thoughtful suggestions on the future development of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the next step, I will be preparing my research for publication with the support of the PGR Publication Scholarship. I look forward to sharing these outcomes and continuing to contribute to the field.&lt;/p&gt;
